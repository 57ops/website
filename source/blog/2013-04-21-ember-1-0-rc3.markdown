Today, we're releasing the third Release Candidate of Ember 1.0.
As we said when we released RC1, the next few releases will be
about bugfixes and improvements, and should not have any breaking
changes.

### Performance

Since RC2 a series of performance improvements have landed.

- When adjacent child views are scheduled for insertion they are
are now batched together, and inserted together rather then piecemeal.

- Object deletion is now async, this prevents un-needed churn when destroying
large interconnected object graphs.

- The amount of objects allocated during view rendering has been cut down.

The recent and ongoing performance effort is being championed 
by Erik Bryn and Kris Selden.

### Testing

Many fixes and improvements to App#reset, which should now correctly
clear application state when invoked. Typically this is only used for
integration tests.

```javascript
// before each integration test
Ember.run(function(){
  App.reset();
});
```
Please note: `App.reset` must be called within an Ember run loop.

Initial work on ember-testing package has begun. The goal of this project
is to make testing Ember applications easier, especially when it comes to
testing asynchrony. As this effort matures, expect full documentation,
examples and guides.

Special thanks to Erik Bryn.

### Ember Builds

Thanks to the hard work of many, including Stanley Stuart, Luke Melia
and Erik Bryn. Each successful CI run, now pushes its build results to
[http://builds.emberjs.com/](http://builds.emberjs.com/). This should make
it much simpler to reference and use the [the latest ember build](http://builds.emberjs.com/ember-latest.js).

### New Input and TextArea helpers
TextField and TextArea views now have corresponding handlebars helpers.

```handlebars
  {{view Ember.TextField valueBinding="name"}}
  {{view Ember.TextArea  valueBinding="name"}}
```

can now be expressed as:

```handlebars
  {{input value="name"}}
  {{textarea value="name"}}
```

### Changelog

The full [CHANGELOG][1] is available on Github, as always.
