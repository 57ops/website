* Do not run functions passed to Ember.assert, Ember.warn, and Ember.deprecate
* Allowing developer to turn off verbose stacktrace in deprecation warnings
* Ember.Route.serialize must return a hash
* lazy setup of ComputedProperties
* change convention from var m = meta(obj) to var meta = metaFor(obj)
* add hook for desc for willWatch and didUnwatch
