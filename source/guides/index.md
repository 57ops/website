Welcome to the Ember.js guides! This documentation will take you from
total beginner to Ember expert. It is designed to start from the most
basic concepts, and slowly increase to more sophisticated concepts
until you know everything there is to know about building awesome web
applications.

To help you get started, we've also made a 30-minute screencast that
will guide you through building a full-featured Ember.js application:

Most of these guides are designed to be very pragmaticâ€”to help you
start building apps right away.

If you'd like to know more about some of the design decisions in
Ember.js, you'll find what you're looking for in the _Understanding
Ember.js_ section.

All of this documentation is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/website/).

We're excited for all of the great apps you're going to build with
Ember.js. To get started, select a topic from the left. They are
presented in the order that we think will be most useful to you as
you're learning Ember.js, but you can also jump to whatever seems
most interesting.

Good luck!
